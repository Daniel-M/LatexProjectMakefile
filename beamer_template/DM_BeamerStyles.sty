\usepackage{listings} % Source code on the text
\usepackage{color}  % it adds support for colored text.

% Usage of listings and color

% \begin{lstlisting}
% put your code here
% \end{lstlisting}
% 
% Another possibility,  is to import the code from the source itself. 
% This way, if you modify the source, you just have to recompile 
% the LaTeX code and your document will be updated.
% 
% \lstinputlisting{source_filename.py}
% 
% in the example there is a Python source, but it doesn't matter: 
% you can include any file but you have to write the full file name. 
% It will be considered plain text and it will be highlighted according to
% your settings, that means it doesn't recognize the programming language by itself.
% You can specify the language while including the file with the following command:
% 
% \lstinputlisting[language=Python]{source_filename.py}

%  You can modify some style by doing the deffinitions

% \lstset{ %
%   language=Octave,                % the language of the code
%   basicstyle=\footnotesize,           % the size of the fonts that are used for the code

%                                   % will be numbered
%   numbersep=5pt,                  % how far the line-numbers are from the code
%   backgroundcolor=\color{white},      % choose the background color. You must add \usepackage{color}
%   showspaces=false,               % show spaces adding particular underscores
%   showstringspaces=false,         % underline spaces within strings
%   showtabs=false,                 % show tabs within strings adding particular underscores
%   frame=single,                   % adds a frame around the code
%   rulecolor=\color{black},        % if not set, the frame-color may be changed on line-breaks within not-black text (e.g. commens (green here))
%   tabsize=2,                      % sets default tabsize to 2 spaces
%   captionpos=b,                   % sets the caption-position to bottom
%   breaklines=true,                % sets automatic line breaking
%   breakatwhitespace=false,        % sets if automatic breaks should only happen at whitespace
%   title=\lstname,                   % show the filename of files included with \lstinputlisting;
%                                   % also try caption instead of title
