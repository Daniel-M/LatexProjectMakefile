% Document class options
% 10pt, 11pt, 12pt 	Sets the size of the main font in the document
% a4paper, letterpaper,... Defines the paper size, besides that, a5paper, b5paper, executivepaper, and legalpaper can be specified.
% fleqn 	Typesets displayed formulas left-aligned instead of centered.
% leqno 	Places the numbering of formulas on the left hand side instead of the right.
% titlepage, notitlepage 	Specifies whether a new page should be started after the document title or not.
% onecolumn, twocolumn 	Instructs LaTeX to typeset the document in one column or two columns.
% twoside, oneside 	Specifies whether double or single sided output should be generated. The option twoside does not tell the printer you use that it should actually make a two-sided printout.
% landscape 	Changes the layout of the document to print in landscape mode.
% openright, openany 	Makes chapters begin either only on right hand pages or on the next page available.
% draft 	makes LaTeX indicate hyphenation and justification problems with a small square in the right-hand margin of the problem line so they can be located quickly by a human. It also suppresses the inclusion of images and shows only a frame where they would normally occur.
